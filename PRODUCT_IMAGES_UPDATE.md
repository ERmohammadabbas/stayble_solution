# Product Images Update - Complete! âœ“

## What Was Done

I've successfully updated your EcomExpress Django e-commerce application so that each product card on both the **home page** and **products page** displays a unique, different image.

### Changes Made:

1. **Downloaded 10 Unique Stock Images** - Each product now has a professional, high-quality product photograph
2. **Organized Media Files** - All images are stored in `media/products/` directory
3. **Updated Database** - Each product has been assigned its unique image

### Product Image Assignments:

| Product ID | Product Name | Image File |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Wireless Bluetooth Headphones | wireless_bluetooth_h_34934def.jpg |
| 2 | Smart Watch Pro | smart_watch_fitness__c5727610.jpg |
